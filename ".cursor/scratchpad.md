### ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: Demo Section Connection Lines Fixed**

**Problem Analysis:**
The demo section connection lines were completely misaligned and didn't connect to the actual UI elements, creating an unprofessional first impression.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Accurate SVG Coordinates**: Fixed hardcoded paths to match actual element positions
   - Audio track right edge: 368px (48px left-12 + 320px w-80)
   - Center processor: 540px (left-[540px])
   - Stem cards center: 1072px (1280px - 48px right-12 - 320px w-80 + 160px half-width)
2. **Clean Hub-and-Spoke Pattern**: Direct lines from center hub (540px, 300px) to each stem card center
3. **Perfect Vertical Alignment**: Calculated exact y-coordinates for each stem card:
   - Vocals: 156px, Drums: 252px, Bass: 348px, Other: 444px
4. **Professional Visual Flow**: Audio track → center processor → 4 stems with clean direct connections
5. **Enhanced Hub Styling**: Added center hub circle and glow effect at exact connection point

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Audio Track Connection**: `M 368 300 L 540 300` (horizontal line to center)
- **Stem Connections**: `M 540 300 L 1072 [y-position]` (direct lines to each stem)
- **Hub Visualization**: Circle at (540, 300) with glow effect
- **Responsive Design**: Coordinates calculated for max-w-7xl container (1280px)

**Result**: ✅ Professional visual demonstration that properly shows the audio separation flow
